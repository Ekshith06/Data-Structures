""""do the shape program with Super class as Shape and Child classes as Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle

The Shape class should contain a default constructor and a cal_area() function written with pass

your task is to create the above mentioned child classes inheriting from the super class Shape

you need to override the function cal_area() which is inherited from the super class shape for your purpose
